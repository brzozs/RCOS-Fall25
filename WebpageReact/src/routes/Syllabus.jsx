      <h1>CSCI-4470-01</h1>
      <h2>Open Source Software Spring Semester 2022</h2>
      <p>Open Source has been taught at RPI since Fall of 2007 (taught jointly by Dr. William Shroeder and Dr. Luis Ibanez) as a 4000 level class, and then by Mukkai Krishnamoorthy as a 2000 level class. We will continue this tradition by offering it as a 4000 level course.</p>
      <p>In the spirit of Open Source, all of the course notes are available online  in Github: <a href="https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource">https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource</a>.</p>

      <p>The course will meet in <strong>Sage 5510</strong> on Tuesdays and Fridays from 10:30pm - 12:35pm. Class discussions are an important part of the lecture and the labs so attendance is required. If you are temporarily unable to attend because of quarantine or other health issues, please contact Prof. Turner and make alternate arrangements.</p>
      <h2>Online LMS and the use of Submitty</h2>
      <p>This course <strong>will not</strong> use the RPI Blackboard LMS. Instead, we will use <strong>Submitty</strong> a course management tool developed as an opensource project under <strong>RCOS</strong> and the creative and technical auspices of Prof. Barbara Cutler. If you are registered in the course, you may access it at <a href="https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/courses/u22/csci4470">https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/courses/u22/csci4470</a>. If you do not have access, please email the TA or the Professor.</p>

      <h2>Policies</h2>
      <p>These will be designated by the instructor in advance to the student and will deal with the following issues. </p>
      <h3>Lateness</h3>
      <p>Late submissions receive a penalty of 10% with an additional 10% penalty (20% total) for up to a week late. Assignments are not generally accepted more than one week late. </p>
      <h3>Class participation</h3>
      <p>Regular attendance and participation is expected.</p>
      <h3>Attendance</h3>
      <p>Regular attendance and participation is expected. </p>
      <h3>Missed exams or assignments:</h3>
      <p>A formal excused absence is required to make up a missed assignment or to turn in an assignment after the due date.</p>
      <h2>Integrity</h2>
      <p>Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process.</p>
      <p>In this course, collaboration in your project group (3 or 4 students) is allowed, but should not be abused. Do not copy blindly. Labs and Quizzes should be solved and written by individuals alone. If anyone is caught cheating, severe measures will be taken such as lowering the final grade, and the event will be reported to the appropriate authorities in the campus.</p>
      <p>The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the Graduate Student Supplement (For 6000 level and above courses) define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. All assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the studentâ€™s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration. Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will result in (1) an academic (grade) penalty and (2) reporting to the Dean of Academic Affairs and either the Dean of Students (for Undergraduates) or the Dean of Graduate Education (for Graduate students).</p>
      <p>In this course, the academic penalty for a first offense is loss of a letter grade. A second offense will result in failure of the course.
      If you have any questions concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.</p>
